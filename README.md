Using the included schema and starter data (you may need to create more data to properly test these queries), write SQL queries that will perform tasks or answer questions as follows:

1. How many comments has each user made per category?
2. Get a listing of all posts grouped by year.
3. How many comments does each user have across all of their posts?
4. Which posts contain a specific keyword?
5. Which category of post has each user made the most comments on?
6. Get a specific user's posts sorted by date of most recent comment.
7. Get all posts by a specific user that have comments, but which that user *hasn't* commented on.
8. Get the top 5 most-commented-on posts that were created in the last 7 days.
9. Get the top 5 wordiest posts (just by character count &ndash; don't actually count words).
10. Get all posts sorted by longest-running comment thread (time between first and last comments).
